# Gucci Mocks
- Named after my dog Gucci, this is a lightweight mocking library that operates on the JUnit5
extension model. Gucci Mocks' main goal is to demystify what goes on under the hood of much larger
Java mocking Frameworks. Gucci Mocks is built with Java and uses Maven as a build system.

## Current version is 1.x
- Gucci-Mocks in currently on its 1.0 version

## Contributing
- Gucci Mocks is still in the beta phase and is not yet ready for open source contributors. However, we
do have one annotation ready `@GucciInject`. If you are interested in using this library, please refer to
[Example Usage](docs/exampleUsage.md) page

Enjoy Gucci-Mocks!
